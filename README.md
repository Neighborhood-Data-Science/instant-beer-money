## Android Users:
I recommend using the [Smart Auto-Clicker by Nain](https://github.com/Nain57/Smart-AutoClicker). (We currently support [version 2.3.4](https://github.com/Nain57/Smart-AutoClicker/releases/tag/2.3.4)).

You can find various base patterns and more information in the [AutoClick Patterns Folder](https://github.com/Neighborhood-Data-Science/instant-beer-money/blob/main/AutoClick%20Patterns/README.md).
