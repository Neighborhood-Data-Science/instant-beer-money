### Payment Methods
A recommended payment method is virtual cards. Virtual cards (VCs) are tied to an actual account (credit, debit, bank, or cryptocurrency), but the card's information, such as expiration date and CVC code, are artificially created. VCs also allow more control by setting spending limits, vendor restrictions, and usage period. 

Some offers require purchasing a subscription for a certain amount of time. Setting the usage period to 'one-time' is a great technique to ensure rougue subscriptions do not charge directly to your bank account. 

I recommend the below VC vendors:
