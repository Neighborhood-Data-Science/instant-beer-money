## Scenario Walkthrough

Scenarios are based on what is currently seen on your device's screen. Therefore, you can make decisions based on certain things that are present (or not) on your screen.

Scenarios are executed from top to bottom. In this way, they act as logic gates based on what is currently seen on the screen.

Our goal in Caesars Slots is to reach a specific player level. The only way to reach the next level is to gain XP by playing the game for a set bet amount. The higher your bet amount, the more XP you will earn per spin. 

As such, it is recommended that you bet between 0.5% and 1.5% of your account size at all times:<br>

### $AccountSize \times0.5\\% \le BetSize \le AccountSize \times1.5\\%$<br>

You should also take advantage of the x2, x3, or x4 XP offers available to purchase. This will allow you to reach the next levels faster while still conserving the approriate risk levels.<br><br>

### **Our advantage is that we can auto spin slots and automatically play bonus games if necessary.**

In summary, our bot will play a slot game, and its associated mini-game, and close necessary windows to continue playing the slot game.

### Here are our scenarios:

---

#### 1. Spin and Stop
    If there is no bonus game playable, spin and manually stop the slot machine. 
    
#### 2. Start Mini
    Click the 'Start' prompt to start playing the slot mini game.

#### 3. Continue Game
    Continue playing the game by clicking 'Back to Game' , 'Claim Prize', or 'Collect' prompts.
    
#### 4. Close Menu
    Close any extra menus that pop up while playing or collecting rewards.
    
Please add additional screenshots and scenarios as needed. For example, the 'Close Menu' scenario will need to be updated as new ads are introduced to the game.

We did our best to capture various menu exit symbols but add more as you monitor the AutoClicker.

**Please monitor your AutoClicker.** There may be unexpected results if left unattended for long periods.
