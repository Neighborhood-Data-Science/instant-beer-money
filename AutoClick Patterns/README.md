This section will serve as storage for AutoClick Patterns created using the [Smart AutoClicker Tool](https://github.com/Nain57/Smart-AutoClicker) created by Nain57.

>Smart AutoClicker is an Android application allowing to automate repetitive task by clicking automatically for you on the screen. Unlike the regular auto clicker application, the clicks aren't based on timers to execute the clicks. Instead, it allows you to capture an image from a part of your screen and execute the click once this image is detected again.

# Initial Setup

1. Download the Smart AutoClicker from GitHub directly on your Android device.
2. Once you have the tool, download the zip folder that corresponds to the game you are interested in from the Games folder.
3. Open the Smart AutoClicker on your Android and click the folder icon to upload a backup file.
4. Select the file you downloaded from the Games folder to import the base pattern to the Smart AutoClicker.

# Game Guides
These game guides will explain the scenarios built into the click pattern and the general flow of the click pattern.
